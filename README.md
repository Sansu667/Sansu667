## 📈 Featured Projects

### **Analysis of Bilibili Gaming's Performance - Worlds 2024**
> Comprehensive statistical analysis of Bilibili Gaming's (BLG) performance at the 2024 League of Legends World Championship. Inferential statistics (ANOVA, Tukey HSD, Confidence Intervals) and predictive modeling (Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees) techniques were used to identify the key factors influencing their results.

> Key Conclusion: BLG demonstrated a champion-level statistical profile, with above-average KDA and average efficiency. Their defeat was attributed to intangible factors (strategy, execution).

**Technique:** R, Knime/LaTeX, ANOVA, Tukey HSD, Linear Regression, Decision Trees
**Result:** The **KDA** was confirmed as the strongest predictor of win, and a custom **Resource Efficiency** metric was created.
